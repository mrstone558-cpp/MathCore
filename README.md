# MathCore
It is a Math library focusing on core principles of linear Algebra. Linear Algebra is the one of the things which power most of the physics block of highly popular `games`. It is also used in `embedded engineering`, physics simulation, etc.

## Use of linear Algebra in Games
- Object movement & rotation.
- Camera movement.
- Physics simulation.
- Collision detection.
- Lighting and shadows.
- Animation transformations.

## Need of MathCore
The need of this library is the complexity of Linear Algebra. The linear Algebra is Powerful but hard to implement, so MathCore will help to directly use instead of wasting hours in implementing it.

## Linear Algebra usable stuff
- vectors
- matrices 
- vector * matrix 
- matrix * matrix 
- matrix formation with `theta`
- dot operator

# Conclusion 
This library can be used not only to perform calculations but also bring numbers to life. This library is still under development so it does not contain everything.

## Thanks
All upgrades will be listed in upgrades.md.
